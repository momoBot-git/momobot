# momobot
Source code for the Discord bot Momobot, created exclusively for one of the servers I'm in.
Attempts to get an image from Pixiv with its id, determines where the faces are in the image, pastes the avatars of the (preferably two) users mentioned in the command onto the characters' faces, and sends the output back into the channel the command was run on.
